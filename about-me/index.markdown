**Director of Technology** at [Wolters Kluwer](https://wolterskluwer.com/) and **lecturer**  in Computer Science at the [University of Geneva](http://www.unige.ch/).
I work as lead architect and team leader in the banking industry. In these positions, I always try to include good software design and testability as a first class citizen.
Over the last 18 years, I had the opportunity to participate to many projects and activities in computer sciences:
- as an engineer and teams leader, to build and to maintain innovative software products
- as a teacher, to communicate my passion for computer sciences, and
- as a researcher, to work on new ideas and methods to improve software quality. 

I am  interested in software 
 [Validation & Verification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation). More specifically, I am interested on how to apply model checking and on how increase the test effectiveness in industrial settings. Furthermore, as a JEE practitioner and teacher, I am always eager to collaborate in new industrial projects.


Third-person professional bio
----------------------------

Sometimes in life people need a third-person bio. I suggest this one for me:

Since April 2016, Dr. Steve Hostettler is head of the Directory of Technology at [Wolters Kluwer](https://wolterskluwer.com/) for the Finance, Risk, And Regulatory Reporting business. Here previously held several positions as lead architect, senior consultant and he worked as a post-doctoral researcher in Computer Science
at the [Software modeling and Verification](https://smv.unige.ch/) laboratory of the 
[University of Geneva](http://www.unige.ch/) where he obtained his PhD in Computer Science. 
*Software craftsman* for quite some time (~14 years). He is mostly interested in 
software [Validation & Verification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation).
He teaches the Java Enterprise Edition platform in the computer science department. His current 
interests lie in how to apply model checking and how increase the test effectiveness in 
industrial settings.

Prior his PhD, he worked, for seven years, as a software engineer 
 and team leader in sectors as various as the retail market, credit card payment systems, logistics or the chemical industry.
